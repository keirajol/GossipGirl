          <h3>A six season roller coaster</h3>
          <img src="images/Serena-blair-sitting.jpg" width="480px" alt="" />
          <p>
            It's 2020 and I finally got around to watching this series. From
            start to finish there is so much wrong with it and so much right it
            left me loving it and hating it. At one point during my binge I felt
            enough is enough is enough and almost stopped. But, and there is
            always a but, I just had to know how the series ended, having no
            fore knowledge. The first two seasons showed me why it was such a
            talked about series. Then the roller coaster ride started. Same old
            stuff over and over only with a make over. The scheming, betrayals,
            and back-stabbing was getting on my nerves. If not for the
            occasional surprise to breakup the predictability and add new
            characters I might have given up. Fortunately, the guys kept it
            together enough to keep me interested. Not that the young ladies
            were not fantastic in their collective rolls. It was just that their
            characters were getting soooooooo annoying. The concept alone was
            great and even the worst episode had it high points. In short my
            rating started with a 10, bounced between 9 and 5 and was saved by
            the ending with 8 as the result.<br /><br />

          <h3>Sleek and sophisticated with B notes.</h3>
          <img src="images/nate.jpg" width="480px" alt="" />
          <p>
            Almost 8 years have passed since I finished watching Gossip Girl.
            Missed it since very much. It was a fun ride where I got to see and
            witness beauty, loveliness, memorable moments, naivety,
            sophistication, devilish and mischievous acts brought to life by a
            hord of extremely talented actors and actresses. Every one of them
            shone and played with near perfection. They brought me happiness and
            sadness. They brought me smiles and tears. I had the pleasure to
            live with them. Who doesn't love the Upper East Side, its everyday
            life, surrounding and sceneries? Who doesn't like the glossiness of
            the show varnished with devilish plots? Who doesn't like the
            opulence of their everyday life? And who doesn't like Blair Waldorf
            AKA Queen B? She is my favorite character of the show. Beautiful,
            funny, mean and sensible at the same time, ever complaining (so
            sweet), always plotting mischief after mischief in ways that only
            she can pull it with ease, beauty and glory. Played by the ultra
            talented, glowingly beautiful and award-winning Leighton Meester who
            dazzles everyone with her smile, brings the series to life, gives it
            embodiment and makes it an unforgettable experience for all viewers
            and fans. She is the epicentre of the show around whom all the
            others keep rotating and gravitating. She is the one without whom
            the series wouldn't exist. If you haven't watched it yet, please do
            so. Embrace its life like it's yours, let its current take you to
            the confines of the Upper East Side with its beauty and mystery and
            fully appreciate it. <br /><br />

          <p>
            There's no way this show is for everybody. It's either you're into
            it or not. It's not pretending to be serious. But at the same time,
            it's always incredibly serious. Everything is live or die. I had a
            not-so-fun Covid experience. With the lethargy, I chose to rewatch
            this 'over a decade old' pop-iconic GG. At one point, Serena and
            Blair had ended their friendship foreve!!!!!. And by the time I woke
            up from a nap they were besties til death so them part (and the same
            story line was playing out between Vanessa and Dan). It's not of
            great substance. But it is of great style. It is not (always the
            best writing), but it has some hilarious plot lines + smart / witty
            moments (def many teams of writers at play). My age group (40), who
            loved The Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles, High Fidelity etc, this
            is the later version. You'll most likely dig it if only in secret.
            Nobody went into this show to win Emmy's. Like the Vampire Diaries
            (not that I've watched that to). These shows are straight up early
            2000s soap operas. They're ridiculous. But THAT is why it's fun. If
            you love drama, fashion and can stand a little bad acting with a
            cast of entirely sexy (mostly) actors, then enjoy. It's like junk
            food. IYKYK. <br /><br />

          <h3>A six season roller coaster</h3>
          <img src="images/blair-with-crown.jpg" width="480px" alt="" />
          <p>
            I started to watch this series last month on Netflix (2015), and was
            so hooked I couldn't wait for the next episode. I also agree with
            all the positive comments. Being born and raised in Manhattan, I
            loved that it took place in my city. Even though I was not raised in
            affluence, The series made me imagine that I did. The acting was so
            superbly done by everyone, especially Ed Westwick and Leighton
            Bleester. Their chemistry was so intense and real, it seemed amazing
            they didn't get together in real life. I'm so sorry that it's over,
            but happy that I can play it over again whenever I want. I think
            that we will be seeing a lot more of Ed Westwick in the future; he
            is an amazing talent. <br /><br />
